# Address Book Project

## Overview

This project is a command-line Address Book program written in C. It allows users to:

- **Add, Edit, and Delete contacts** with details like name, address, phone number, and email.
- **Search contacts** by name, phone number, or email.
- **Display all contacts** with sorting options.
- **Save and Exit**, ensuring that all updates are reflected in a CSV file.

The project is modular and keeps contact information in a CSV file located in the `data/` folder.

### Project Structure

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **GCC compiler** or any C compiler that supports C99.
- Make sure you have the necessary directory structure (`data/`) and CSV files (`data.csv`, `temp.csv`) in place.

### Clone the Repository

To clone this project, run:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/SahilSahikh/addressbook-in-C-Programming-language.git>

```

### Directory Setup

Ensure the `data` folder exists with the following structure:

```
addressBook/
â””â”€â”€ data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ data.csv
    â””â”€â”€ temp.csv

```

You can create the `data.csv` and `temp.csv` files if they don't exist. They will be updated automatically as you add contacts.

### Compilation

To compile the project, use this command:

```bash
gcc -o addressBook main.c functions/*.c -Iinclude

```

### Running the Program

After compiling, you can run the executable as follows:

```bash
./addressBook
